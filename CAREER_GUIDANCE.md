## 💡 Addressing the "No Degree" Issue

### The Reality:
- **Startups:** Rarely care about degrees (30% will filter you out)
- **Product Companies:** May care (50% will filter you out)
- **Service Companies:** Often require degrees (70% will filter you out)
- **Remote Companies:** Mixed, but skills-focused (40% will filter you out)

### How to Overcome:

1. **Target the Right Companies**
   - Apply to companies that explicitly say "degree not required"
   - Look for "self-taught friendly" in job descriptions
   - Prioritize startups (especially YC companies)

2. **Make Your Portfolio Stand Out**
   - Your project needs to be better than degree-holders' projects
   - **You've already done this!** ✅

3. **Network Strategically**
   - Connect with founders and engineering leaders on Twitter/LinkedIn
   - Attend tech meetups (virtual or in-person)
   - Contribute to open-source
   - Write technical blog posts

4. **Get Your First Job (Most Important)**
   - Your first job is the hardest
   - Once you have 1 year of experience, the degree matters MUCH less
   - After 2 years, the degree barely matters
   - After 5 years, it doesn't matter at all

5. **Consider Freelancing/Contract Work**
   - Build 6-12 months of paid experience
   - Then apply to full-time roles with "experience"
   - Platforms: Upwork, Toptal (difficult), Gun.io

---

## 🎓 Should You Get a Degree?

### Short Answer: **Not necessarily, but it depends**

### Skip the Degree If:
- ✅ You can get a job within 3-6 months
- ✅ You're in a good tech ecosystem (Bangalore, US, Europe)
- ✅ You're focused on startups/remote work
- ✅ You can continue self-learning effectively
- ✅ Financial pressure to start earning

### Consider a Degree If:
- ⚠️ You can't land a job within 6-12 months
- ⚠️ You want to work at Big Tech (FAANG)
- ⚠️ You want a safety net
- ⚠️ You want traditional career options
- ⚠️ Immigration concerns (degree helps with work visas)

### Middle Ground:
- Start applying to jobs NOW
- If you get an offer → take it, skip degree
- If you don't get offers in 6 months → consider:
  - Online degree (cheaper, flexible)
  - Part-time degree while working
  - Bootcamp with job guarantee

**Your project quality suggests you can land a job without a degree.**
